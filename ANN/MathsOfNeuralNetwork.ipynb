    "A neural network is a bunch of logistic regression stacked together. A simple neural network has only one hidden layer whereas a deep neural network consists of multiple hidden layers. Every node in one layer is connected to every other node in the next layer. We make the network deeper by increasing the number of hidden layers. \n",

    "This post assumes that you have a basic understanding of the intuition behind the neural network. There are so many articles on neural networks on the internet, so I won't want to reinvent the wheel. A few of them which I found useful can be found [here](http://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-deep-learning-part-1-artificial-neural-networks-d7834f67a4f6). You may wonder then why I am writing this post? When I was learning neural network I had a lot of struggle understanding the back propagation - even the online articles didn't help much. Then I did Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization course. I must admit he has a very simple way of explaining the most complicated concept. In this post, I will be covering backpropagation in detail. This is my attempt to give back what I learned. This post will deal with the theoretical concept, in the next post, we will apply this concept and build a homegrown neural network with Python."

    "Neural Network, like any machine learning algorithm, is a supervised learning algorithm. That means we have historic data and the corresponding label that the data maps to. The job of the neural network, like most machine learning algorithms is to find the parameters which when applied on the model will optimally fit the data. Let's take an example of a two-layer neural network with a hidden layer of three nodes. For simplicity let's consider the input layer with two features and a binary output. The term hidden layer refers to the fact that in the training set, the true values for these nodes in the middle are not observed. We don't consider the input layer in the layer count. Every node on the neural network behaves like a logistic regression unit with an affine layer followed by a non-linear transformation. Essentially what each layer of the neural network does is a non-linear transformation of the input from one vector space to another. We will define items of layer-1 with superscript 1 (for eg. affine layer will be termed $Z^{[1]}$ and the activation layer as $A^{[1]}$) and layer-2 as superscript 2 ($Z^{[2]},A^{[2]}$) and so on."
